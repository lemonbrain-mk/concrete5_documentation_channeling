# Concrete5 documentation channeling
Find a short workflow description to channeling all discussion apps back to the documentation. This is just one part out of this [proposal](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/c5-doc-team), which we think should be done as a first step.

## Issue
Normal way of documentation should be after some changing in the github:

github -> documentation


The documentation should always be the source of truth and very well searchable.

But Sometimes there are missing documentation, unclear documentation, wrong documentation or something like this. Then other Apps are used to discuss that task. Concrete5 recommend the following for it: Concrete5 Site Forum, Stack Overflow, Slack and IRC. Now the problem is, that a lot of informations in this tools get lost and asked many times again. Cause of not putting it back to the documentation or even cause the app is not even proper searchable. So we are looking for an easy workflow to bring this informations to the documentation.

Concrete5 Site Forum -> documentation<br>
Stack Overflow -> documentation<br>
Slack -> documentation<br>
IRC -> documentation<br>
