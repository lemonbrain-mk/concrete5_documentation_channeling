# concrete5 documentation channeling
Find a short workflow description to channeling all discussion apps back to the documentation. This is just one part out of this [proposal](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/c5-doc-team), which we think should be done as a first step.

## Issue
Normal way of documentation should be after some changing on github:

github -> documentation


The documentation should always be the source of truth and very well searchable.

But Sometimes there are missing documentation, unclear documentation, wrong documentation or something like this. Then other Apps are used to discuss that task. concrete5 recommend the following for it: concrete5 Site Forum, Stack Overflow, Slack and IRC. Now the problem is, that a lot of informations in this tools get lost and asked many times again. Cause of not putting it back to the documentation or even cause the app is not even proper searchable. 

## 1. Possible solution (mentioned from lemonbrain)
This way should be published on concrete5.org and known from as many community members as possible to act like little police men. For a benefit for all of us and specially for new community members and concrete5 users.

### Apps supported
The channels for discussion which acts like the input for the workflow should be defined and are at the moment the following to start with:
* concrete5 Site Forum
* Stack Overflow
* Slack

### Workflow
So we are looking for an easy workflow to bring this informations to the documentation.

concrete5 Site Forum -> documentation<br>
Stack Overflow -> documentation<br>
Slack -> documentation

#### How we could solve this
Discussion -> Pre Documentation / Tasksystem -> Documentation

It needs an **easy export** from this three apps to a pre documentation system (which acts like a tasksystem (priority, process state, people who takes care about etc), but is also well searchable). So that the effort to put it there is really low. Then from there a documentation team brings it in a form and to the official documentation. 

So if i have a problem with the documentation, i look in the Pre Documentation and after this i ask in one of the three channels. After this it is my responsibillity to put it in the pre documentation and the respobsibillity from the community to tell me.

#### Easy export
This needs to be defined for every of this three channels. Maybe by addons or least copy/paste.

## 2. Possible solution (mentioned from JohntheFish, written from lemonbtain at the moment)
Cause nobody likes to write documentation, he mentioned to use apps (in the best way one) for discussion which are well searchable by google. So the information gets by nature not lost.

### He wrote
We currently have 2 application requirements:
1) A new forum for threaded discussion (with googlability)
2) A chat app with history and googlability

If we can combine the 2 into one application, so much the better as long as it does not involve too big a compromise on the fundamental characteristics of each. For example: A forum that provides instant response to users with the forum open in a browser, so any forum thread effectively becomes a chat stream. A chat app that provides threads and organisation like a forum would.

Nevertheless, I would be happy with limited compromise in order to have it all in one application. One of the most damaging things to the concrete5 community is fragmentation. We currently have concrete5 presecene split across concrete5.org forums, slack, howtos, concretePHP google group, stackoverflow, bug reports, github issues, reddit, twitter, facebook, concrete5.org blog (are there others......).

If you look at some of these, the torpid activity only serves to discredit concrete5 as a whole, while others fragment the community. If concrete5 is to be credible in the overall OS and CMS space, we need consolidation of the various communication channels to strengthen the community and the credibility of concrete5 as a whole.

We will never achieve an all-in-one application. But perhaps with pruning of some of the near-dead channels and careful choice of an application to integrate others under an umbrella application (the new forum or chat), we can integrate communication sufficiently to make the whole community more cohesive.

### Possible Apps
Here a google spreadsheet will be linked with pros and contras for different possible apps to solve the requirements.
