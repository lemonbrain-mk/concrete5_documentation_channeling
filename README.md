# Concrete5 documentation channeling
Find a short workflow description to channeling all discussion apps back to the documentation. This is just one part out of this [proposal](https://github.com/gondwanasoft/c5-doc-team), which we think should be done as a first step.

## Issue
Normal way of documentation should be after some changing in the github:

github -> documentation


The documentation should always be the source of truth and very well searchable.

But Sometimes there are missing documentation, unclear documentation, wrong documentation or something like this. Then other Apps are used to discuss that task. Concrete5 recommend the following for it: Concrete5 Site Forum, Stack Overflow, Slack and IRC. Now the problem is, that a lot of informations in this tools get lost and asked many times again. Cause of not putting it back to the documentation or even cause the app is not even proper searchable. So we are looking for an easy workflow to bring this informations to the documentation.

Concrete5 Site Forum -> documentation<br>
Stack Overflow -> documentation<br>
Slack -> documentation<br>
IRC -> documentation<br>

## 1. possible Solution (mentioned from lemonbrain)
This way should be published on concrete5.org and known from as many community member as possible to act like little police men. For a benefit for all of us and specially for new community members / Concrete5 users.

### Apps supported
The channels for discussion which acts like the input for the workflow should be defined and are at the moment the following to start with:
* Concrete5 Site Forum
* Stack Overflow
* Slack

### Workflow
Discussion -> Pre Documentation / Tasksystem -> Documentation

It needs a easy export from this three apps to a pre documentation system (which acts like a tasksystem (priority, process state, people who takes care about etc), but is also well searchable). So that the effort to put it there is really low. Then from there a documentation team brings it in a form and to the official documentation.

So if i have a problem with the documentation, i look in the Pre Documentation and after this i ask in one of the three channels. After this it is my responsibillity to put it in the pre documentation and the respobsibillity from the community to tell me.
